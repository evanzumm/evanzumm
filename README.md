💚 Hello! I am Emily Van Zummeren 💚

❤️ I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development at ASU Online ❤️

I currently work at Starbucks ☕ but hope to still work for them after graduation. I don't know much about coding, but do enjoy learning it! I really enjoy graphic design and hope to build a diverse set of skills with my degree 🎓
